### Explain difference between .NET and C# ?
C# is a programming language, while .NET is a software development framework/platform. You use C# to write code, and .NET provides the runtime, libraries, and tools to run and build applications.


### What is C#?
- Definition: C# (pronounced “C-sharp”) is a modern, object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft.
- Purpose: It’s used to write code that runs on the .NET platform.
- Features: Strongly typed, component-oriented, supports modern programming paradigms (OOP, LINQ, async/await).
- Usage Examples: Writing business logic, algorithms, desktop apps, web apps, and even game development (Unity uses C#).

### What is .NET?
- Definition: .NET is a development framework/platform created by Microsoft. It includes a runtime (CLR – Common Language Runtime), libraries, and tools.
- Purpose: Provides the environment where C# (and other languages like F#, VB.NET) can run.
#### Components:
- .NET Framework / .NET Core / .NET 5+ – runtime and base libraries.
- ASP.NET Core – for web applications.
- Entity Framework Core – for database access.
- .NET MAUI – for cross-platform mobile/desktop apps.
- Usage Examples: Hosting web APIs, running desktop apps, powering cloud services, and integrating with databases.
