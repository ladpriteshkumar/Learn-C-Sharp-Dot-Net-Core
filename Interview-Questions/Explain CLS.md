### Explain CLS

The Common Language Specification (CLS) is another cornerstone of the .NET ecosystem, closely related to the Common Type System (CTS).

🧩 What CLS Is
- Definition: CLS is a set of rules and guidelines that all .NET languages must follow to ensure interoperability.
- Role: It defines a subset of features from the CTS that are common across all .NET languages.
- Purpose: Makes sure that code written in one .NET language can be used reliably in another.

⚙️ Importance of CLS

✅ Language Interoperability

- Ensures that libraries written in one language (e.g., C#) can be consumed by another (e.g., VB.NET).

✅ Consistency

- Provides a standard baseline of features that all .NET languages support.
  
✅ Simplifies Development

- Developers don’t need to worry about language-specific quirks when sharing code.

✅ Promotes Reusability

- Libraries and components can be reused across different projects and languages.


🔑 Relationship Between CTS and CLS
- CTS (Common Type System): Defines all possible types and rules in .NET.
- CLS (Common Language Specification): Defines a subset of CTS that all languages agree to support.
  
Think of CTS as the full dictionary, and CLS as the common vocabulary that everyone understands.
