The stack is used for static memory allocation (local variables, function calls) and is fast but limited in size, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation (objects, data structures) and is flexible but slower and prone to fragmentation


🧠 Stack Memory
- Definition: A region of memory that stores local variables and function call information.
- Allocation: Happens automatically when a function is called.
- Deallocation: Freed immediately when the function ends.
- Speed: Very fast because the system manages it directly.
- Structure: Contiguous block of memory, grows/shrinks in a predictable order (LIFO).
- Limitations:
- Limited size (stack overflow if exceeded).
- Variables must have a known size at compile time.
- Cannot resize variables once allocated.

📦 Heap Memory
- Definition: A region of memory used for dynamic allocation (objects, arrays, data structures).
- Allocation: Controlled by the programmer (e.g., malloc in C, new in C++/Java).
- Deallocation: Must be explicitly freed (C/C++) or handled by garbage collection (Java, C#).
- Speed: Slower than stack due to complex bookkeeping.
- Structure: Non-contiguous, can allocate memory blocks in arbitrary order.
- Flexibility:
- Variables can be resized.
- Accessible globally across functions.
- Can lead to fragmentation if not managed properly.


# Key Differences: Stack vs Heap

| Aspect            | Stack                               | Heap                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Allocation**    | Automatic (handled by compiler/runtime) | Manual (programmer or garbage collector) |
| **Speed**         | Faster                              | Slower                              |
| **Size**          | Limited, fixed                      | Large, flexible                     |
| **Lifetime**      | Tied to function scope              | Until freed or garbage collected    |
| **Fragmentation** | Never fragmented                    | Can become fragmented               |
| **Access**        | Local variables only                | Global access possible              |
