### 1. [Explain difference between .NET and C# ?](https://github.com/ladpriteshkumar/Learn-C-Sharp-Dot-Net-Core/blob/0fbd102f867eba96fca1cd610d9dd1c258827c72/Interview-Questions/Explain%20difference%20between%20.NET%20and%20C%23.md)

### 2. .NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET 5.0 (Difference) ?

### 3. What is IL ( Intermediate Language)  ?
Intermediate Language (IL), also called CIL (Common Intermediate Language) or MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language), is the platform-independent bytecode that all .NET languages (like C#, VB.NET, F#) compile into. At runtime, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) translates IL into native machine code using the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler

### 4. What is the use of JIT ( Just in time compiler) ?
The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler in .NET converts Intermediate Language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime.

Its main use is to make .NET applications platform-independent during development while still achieving high performance when executed.

#### Execution
Source code (e.g., C#) → compiled into IL → JIT translates IL into machine code specific to the CPU/OS

### 5. Is it possible to view IL code ?
Yes ✅, it’s absolutely possible to view IL (Intermediate Language) code from your compiled .NET assemblies. Developers often do this to understand what the compiler generated, debug performance issues, or learn how high-level C# translates into IL.

### 6. What is the benefit of compiling in to IL code ?

### 7. Does .NET support multiple programming languages ?
Yes
    
### 3) [Data Type in C#](DataType/README.md) ? ###
### 2) Explain Type casting in C# ? ###
